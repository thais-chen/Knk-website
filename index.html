			<article id="about">
				<h3 class="major">About</h3>
	
				<h3>Not Just a Sport, but a Life Skill</h3>
	
				<p class="lead"> We believe that swimming is a basic human action, something that a regrettable amount of
					people
					cannot do. It is a life skill that teaches perseverance, confidence, trains the body, and builds
					character. We are coaches that want to bring out the best in any student that we teach, knowing that
					each swimmer is unique, requiring innovative approaches to swimming. </p>
				<p class="lead"> Between the two of us, we have taught swimming for 15 years, swam on teams for 12 years,
					and
					life-guarded for 10 years. We have taught over 2000 students over our careers, and feel confident
					that we can teach anyone to swim. We believe in constant self-improvement, learning new methods and
					styles of swimming and coaching so that we can be the best for our students.</p>
				<p class="lead"> We are elite competitive swim instructors that do not waste time with aimless games and simple
					entertainment.
					Unlike most swim schools, everything that we do is geared towards getting our students to be
					water-safe and to swim properly. Our games, songs, and all other exercises have an educational
					purpose.</p>
				<p class="lead"> The basic necessity for swimming is water safety. Drowning is a very real problem in the
					United
					States, evidenced by a National Safety Council statistic that 74% of drowning deaths for kids under
					15 occurred at a residential location (a pool). This issue should not be a factor in human society,
					and for this reason, we wish to teach as many students the love and respect for water.</p>
				<p class="lead"> According to Psychology Today, 46% of ADULT Americans fear the deep end of the pool. As a
					child,
					being afraid can lead to panic and self-doubt, and avoiding even attempting to learn, which may
					reflect in future situations, such as Price and school. Building confidence through hard Price and
					rewarding struggle teaches children about their capabilities and builds self-worth. Finally, the
					health benefits of swimming are nearly limitless, training the lungs, heart, and the body, granting
					a lifetime of health benefits. For this reason we push students to set goals and then overcome them,
					improving their lives.</p>

					THE FIRM APPROACH
					<small class="text-muted"><br>Our Proven Philosophy</small>
				</h3>
	
				<h1 class="display-6">Our Premier Package and Guarantee</h1>
				<p class="lead"> This is an intensive package that is tailored to clients who wish to get their swimmer (or
					themselves)
					to be water-safe and capable of swimming in the least amount of time. It is intended to have a minimum
					of 3 lessons
					a week, but 5 is ideal.
	
					We guarantee water safety for anyone over the age of 4 (Four) within the span of one package, and any
					required
					lessons after the 10th (Tenth) one would be free if the student is not water safe (until they become
					water safe).
				</p>
				<h1 class="display-6">The Terms of the Package</h1>
				<p class="lead"> This package includes all fees (travel and reservation fees), so the price that you see is
					the price
					that you pay. If you are not satisfied with our work after 3 lessons, we will return the remainder (7
					lessons'
					worth) of your payment.
				</p>
				<h1 class="display-6">The Price for Water Safety</h1>
				<p class="lead"> Other swim schools and YMCA-style programs charge $3000 on average to teach ONE student to
					be water
					safe, and this is usually done in their pool.
	
					We charge $1800 for 10 full-hour lessons for one student, with lessons done at your pool, with your
					convenience in
					mind.

				<p class="lead"> We Are Elite Competitive Private Swim Instructors. We are certified American Red Cross Water Safety
					Instructors and associated with USA Swimming (The largest swim teaching/coaching association in the
					United States).
	
					Our prices reflect the quality that we provide to our clients, and they are more affordable than less
					advanced programmes at other schools ($1800 to teach someone aged 4+ to swim rather than $3000+).
	
					We make sure to get the job done. Additionally, our instructors come to you, saving you money and time
					on travelling to other schools' pools.
	
					We also teach for 30 minutes to an Hour, compared to the 15-20 minutes that most schools provide.

				<p> Kevin is an amazing coach. Our daughter improved with his lessons instantly. He makes the sessions fun, but at the same time keeps her working hard. His explanations on what to do and how to fix mistakes are straight to the point, so improvement is instant... honestly, by just looking at him training my 7 year old daughter I picked up a few tips, and was able to significantly improve my brass stroke... amazing. Thought I was just quickly getting tired, turned out it is not the case after I adjusted my technique myself. Highly recommend!!!!</p>

			  <p>Ki and Kevin are literally THE swim lesson guru’s. My 4 year old daughter was terrified of even going anywhere near the water and now she can’t wait to get in the pool. Their methods are second to none and more importantly the trust they built with her was more impressive than anything. 12/10 would recommend to anyone. These guys are the real deal</p>

<p> My 4 year old daughter started lessons with coach Kevin and coach Ki at end of May 2021 and she loves working with them. Their gentle approach to lessons has helped her feel comfortable and confident in the water. She has improved and is nearly water safe in just 4 lessons. I can’t wait to see how far she will advance over the next month of lessons. The coaches are very experienced, responsible and fun your child is in the best hands.</p>		  <cite>
